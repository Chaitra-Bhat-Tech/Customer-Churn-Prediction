# Project Overview
The Customer Churn Prediction System is a machine learning–based web application that predicts whether a customer is likely to stop using a service (churn) based on demographic details, usage behavior, and subscription information.
The project combines data analysis, machine learning, and web development to provide real-time churn predictions through a simple web interface.

# Objective
The main goal of this project is to:
	•	Analyze customer behavior data
	•	Build a supervised machine learning model to predict churn
	•	Deploy the trained model using a Flask web application for real-time predictions

# Machine Learning Approach
	•	Problem Type: Binary Classification
	•	Target Variable: Churn (0 = No Churn, 1 = Churn)
	•	Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression
	•	Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix

# Technologies Used
	•	Programming Language: Python
	•	Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Joblib
	•	Web Framework: Flask
	•	Frontend: HTML, CSS
	•	Development Tools: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code
	•	Version Control: Git & GitHub
